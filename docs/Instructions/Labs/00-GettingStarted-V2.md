# OpenAI End-to-End Baseline


### Overall Estimated Duration: 5 Hours

### Overview

This hands-on lab series provides a comprehensive workflow for utilizing Azure OpenAI Service and Azure App Service. Participants will first create, test, and deploy a prompt flow, ensuring its functionality through runtime testing. The lab then guides users in cloning and enhancing the prompt flow before deploying it to an Azure Machine Learning-managed online endpoint. Following this, participants will publish a chat front-end web application and deploy the flow to Azure App Service. Finally, they will build and push a container image for the chat flow and host it on Azure App Service to enable scalable, web-based interactions.

## Objective 
The objective of these labs is to guide participants through creating, deploying, and managing prompt flows and chat applications using Azure OpenAI Service and Azure App Service.

1. **Managing and Enhancing Prompt Flows**: This hands-on exercise aims to guide participants through the creation, testing, and optimization of prompt flows to ensure efficient and effective deployment.

2. **Deploying to Azure Machine Learning Endpoints and Publishing Web Applications**: This hands-on exercise aims on how to deploy prompt flows to Azure Machine Learning endpoints and publish associated web applications.

3. **Deploying and Managing Chat Flow Containers on Azure App Service**: This hands-on exercise aims to teach participants how to deploy, build, and manage chat flow container images on Azure App Service for scalable web hosting.

## Prerequisites

 1. Familiarity with coding and containerization concepts, especially related to building and managing Docker images.
 2. Knowledge of tools like Azure CLI or Azure Portal for deploying and managing resources, along with a development environment for coding and testing, is required.

## Architecture

The labs utilize the Azure OpenAI Service API for creating and testing prompt flows, Azure Machine Learning for deploying and managing online endpoints, and Azure App Service for hosting the chat flow web app and container image. Resources include Azure CLI or Azure Portal for deployment and management and containerization tools for building and pushing images.
